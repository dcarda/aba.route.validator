Reflow skin is an open-source project and all contributions are welcome to assist with its
development and maintenance. The skin originated as a new skin for the upcoming
[Community Z Tools][czt] release, which uses Maven site for its documentation.

Along the way I realised that the skin is becoming general enough to be released separately so that
the whole community can benefit. Reflow Maven skin and the associated Reflow Velocity tools can be
used freely and are released under [Apache license][apache-license].
