[Full usage instructions &raquo;][reflow-usage]

[reflow-usage]: skin/


## Responsive layouts

Write your pages in [APT or Markdown][doxia-formats], then restructure them using Reflow skin
[layouts][reflow-layouts]:

-   **Carousel** - spinning image slideshow
-   **Thumbnails** - showcase your image gallery
-   **Columns** - multi-column text
-   **Sidebar** - wrap into a sidebar
-   **Body** - text as it has been written

Partition the page into sections using `<hr/>` elements, and define preferred layouts for each section in `site.xml`. Reflow skin is responsive thanks to [Bootstrap][bootstrap], so the layouts
will be rearranged automatically for readability on small screens.
